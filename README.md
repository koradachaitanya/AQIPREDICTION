# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction System

A modern web application for predicting and understanding Air Quality Index (AQI) levels using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time AQI Prediction**: Calculate AQI based on multiple air quality parameters
- **Interactive UI**: Beautiful and responsive design with intuitive controls
- **Educational Content**: Detailed information about each parameter and their health impacts
- **Visual Feedback**: Dynamic color-coded indicators and meters
- **Health Recommendations**: Contextual health advice based on AQI levels

## 🔍 Parameters Measured

- **PM2.5** (Particulate Matter): 0-500 μg/m³
- **NO2** (Nitrogen Dioxide): 0-2000 ppb
- **O3** (Ozone): 0-500 ppb
- **CO** (Carbon Monoxide): 0-50 ppm

## 🎯 AQI Levels and Health Implications

| Level | AQI Range | Category | Health Implications |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | 0-50 | Good | Air quality is satisfactory |
| 2 | 51-100 | Moderate | Acceptable air quality |
| 3 | 101-150 | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups | May affect sensitive individuals |
| 4 | 151-200 | Unhealthy | Everyone may experience effects |
| 5 | 201-300 | Very Unhealthy | Emergency conditions warning |
| 6 | 301-500 | Hazardous | Serious health effects for all |
